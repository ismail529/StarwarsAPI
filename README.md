# StarwarsAPI
Test framework for the starwars API. Contains mutliple DTO's which are injected for testing purposes(using a url to access the starwars api) and can be further extended depending if the chosen api changes. To accomodate the api changes start by creating new DTO's and modifying the injector class to contain the new DTO's and create new tests to test the new api modifications.
